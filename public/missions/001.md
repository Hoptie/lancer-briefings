# Mission // #001
## Shut Down Project Blackwing
# Goals
- Destroy all Evidence of Imperial Involvement
- Quarantine and Retrieve any survivors.

# Stakes
- The Public and other branches of our own government cannot be made aware of the experiments conducted here. A controlled extraction and destruction of the ship is the only way to ensure no scavenger comes across the results of our research.

# Reserves
- 2nd Squad - Stormtrooper Division 693
