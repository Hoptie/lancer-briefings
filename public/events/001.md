Welcome Lancers to Third Resurrection's Simulation Grid. You have been selected by our scouts for membership in the Third's 
mobile cavalry division. Your presence here is based on a belief that your aptitude for Lancer combat is sufficient enough 
to be further tested. Do note, these two simulated missions are a part of the selection process. We will be gathering detailed 
information on your battle performance during these excercises for rapid integration with existing Third Pilots. Perform well 
here and you will be awarded with the GMS-Everest Certification at our fab center.
